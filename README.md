# VarHandler

Tired of changing variables ?
Don't you dare Varry (pun intended)
VarHandler replaces variables in C, CPP, PY files with random words/characters
Not even variables inside functions and classes can escape from being replaced 

Feel free to DM me in Discord : GoViper#4511
PS : for a variable to change, length of the respective variable needs to be greater than 3
