# VarHandler

Tired of changing variables ? </br>
Don't you dare Varry (pun intended) </br>
VarHandler replaces variables in C, CPP, PY files with random words/characters</br>
Not even variables inside functions and classes can escape from being replaced </br>

Feel free to DM me in Discord : GoViper#4511 </br>
PS : for a variable to change, length of the respective variable needs to be greater than 3
